# ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts

Welcome to the ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts repository. This repository hosts Ethereum smart contracts designed to provide robust functionality for managing ERC20 tokens securely.

## Overview

This project consists of two main contracts:

1. **ERC20 Token Contract**: A standard implementation of the ERC20 token standard, offering features such as token transfers, approvals, and balance inquiries.
   
2. **Vault Contract**: A secure storage solution for ERC20 tokens, featuring access control mechanisms, permission management, and emergency stop functionality.

## Features

### ERC20 Token Contract

- **Standard Compliance**: Implements the ERC20 standard for seamless integration with various Ethereum wallets and decentralized applications.
- **Transfer Functionality**: Allows users to transfer tokens between addresses securely and efficiently.
- **Approval System**: Enables users to approve other addresses to spend tokens on their behalf, facilitating decentralized exchanges and token allowances.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Provides a method for users to check their token balance.

### Vault Contract

- **Secure Storage**: Safeguards tokens within the contract logic, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Access Control**: Restricts token withdrawals to authorized addresses only, enhancing security.
- **Permission Management**: Allows administrators to grant or revoke permissions for interacting with the vault contract.
- **Emergency Stop**: Includes a feature to halt token withdrawals temporarily in case of emergencies or unforeseen circumstances.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy both contracts to the Ethereum network using a compatible Ethereum client or development tool.
   
2. **Configuration**: Set up permissions, access controls, and any other parameters according to your requirements.

3. **Interaction**: Interact with the contracts using authorized addresses to deposit, withdraw, and manage tokens securely.
